suggestion, and you can customize it to your liking.\n* Hotel prices are approximate and may vary depending on the season and availability.\n* Many attractions in Las Vegas offer discounted tickets if purchased online in advance.\n* Consider taking advantage of the free activities and attractions, such as the Fremont Street Experience, the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Garden, and the Strip. \n* Keep in mind that Las Vegas is a very walkable city, so you can easily explore many attractions on foot.\n* Public transportation is available, but taxis and ride-sharing services are also readily available.\n* The best time to visit Las Vegas is in the spring or fall when the weather is mild. Summer can be extremely hot, and winter can be cold and windy.\n* Most casinos and attractions are open 24 hours a day, but it\'s always a good idea to check operating hours in advance.\n',
